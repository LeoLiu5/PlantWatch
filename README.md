# Hope for Growth: Enhancing Indoor Hydroponic Farming with IoT Technology, Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and Flutter Mobile Application.

This project combined the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile application development, and deep learning to simplify monitoring and maintenance processes in hydroponics. By continuously monitoring key parameters such as water quality (TDS), air temperature, relative humidity, and hydroponic solution level, the system aimed to create an optimal environment for vegetable growth with supplementary light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. This real-time monitoring allowed for timely adjustments and interventions to maintain ideal conditions within the hydroponics setup. IoT was utilized to transfer sensor data and images to Cloud Firebase and Firebase Storage through Wi-Fi. The mobile application PlantWatch could provide real-time information about the status of the hydroponics system, making monitoring and maintenance more convenient. By reducing manual efforts and enabling remote monitoring, this project aims to enhance the efficiency and success of hydroponic cultivation while providing users with greater convenience and control. The success will allow for further educational opportunities in these subjects and hopefully lead to an interest in implementing urban farming techniques in households.
